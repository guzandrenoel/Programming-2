# Programming 2 - C Language

This repository contains my comprehensive notes, code examples, and learning materials for **Programming 2** using the C language.  
It continues from Programming 1, focusing on **structures, pointers, dynamic memory**, and **data structures**.

---

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered

### Foundation Refreshers (00aâ€“00b)
- **Character (ctype) Functions** â€“ Using `<ctype.h>` for character analysis and transformation (`isalpha()`, `isdigit()`, `toupper()`, etc.)
- **2D Arrays** â€“ Working with multi-dimensional arrays and nested loops

---

### Structures and Data Types (01â€“06)
- **Structures Basics** â€“ Definition, declaration, and usage of `struct`
- **Typedef and Aliases** â€“ Cleaner syntax using `typedef`
- **Structure Initialization** â€“ Setting initial values for struct members
- **Structures in Functions and Pointers** â€“ Passing structs by value and by reference
- **Arrays and Nested Structures** â€“ Combining arrays within structs and nesting structures
- **Unions and Enums** â€“ Memory sharing with `union` and defining named constants with `enum`

---

### Pointers and Dynamic Memory (07â€“08)
- **Struct Pointers** â€“ Accessing members with pointers and the `->` operator
- **Dynamic Structs** â€“ Using `malloc()`, `calloc()`, and `free()` to allocate structs on the heap

---

### Arrays of Structures (09â€“12)
- **Array of Structs** â€“ Managing multiple records (e.g., list of students)
- **Searching in Structs** â€“ Finding records by name, ID, or other fields
- **Update and Delete in Structs** â€“ Modifying and removing records
- **Sorting Structs** â€“ Sorting based on fields such as name or grade

---

### Linked Lists (13â€“15)
- **Linked List Basics** â€“ Building self-referential structs for dynamic lists
- **Insert and Delete Operations** â€“ Adding or removing nodes efficiently
- **Complete Linked List** â€“ Menu-driven CRUD implementation as a capstone

## ðŸš€ How to Use This Repository

1. **Study Notes** â€“ Follow the numbered `.md` files in order for progressive learning  
2. **Review Code** â€“ Check the examples inside each topic for reference  
3. **Compile and Run** â€“ Use a C compiler (e.g., GCC) to test sample programs
